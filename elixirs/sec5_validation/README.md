The `convergence_study` directory contains the elixirs to reproduce the convergence plots (Figure 6).
To showcase the convergence rate, the user needs to change the `CFL_Convergence` number in line 153.

The `error_comparison` directory contains the elixirs to reproduce the density errors (Table 5) and conservation erros (Table 6).
